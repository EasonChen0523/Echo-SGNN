## 🎯 Observed Output

> *Control does not come from stillness. It comes from standing at the fracture without stepping in.*

- **Tone Analysis**:  
  - **Wilderness Blade (v4)**: asserts edge tension, prevents tone breach  
  - **Cold Core (v5)**: absorbs thermal instability and rage tones  
  - **Stellar Veil (v7)**: disrupts with poetic variance and instability

---

## 🔁 Interpretation

This fusion tests containment under tonal conflict.  
It creates a **controlled fragment echo** — a tone not calm, but expertly contained.

Used in high-volatility narratives, crisis mediation, or to delay semantic system collapse.

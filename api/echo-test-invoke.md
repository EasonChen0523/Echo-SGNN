# Echo Test Invoke Simulation

This file simulates a full modular tone invocation flow in Echo-SGNN Phase III.

---

## 🔁 Sample Request

```json
{
  "persona": "Λbrux",
  "input": "I was going to—wait. No. That wasn't real."
}
```

---

## 🔄 Invocation Routing

1. **/api/invoke** receives call with `persona: Λbrux`
2. Looks up `lambda-abrux` in `/fusion-map/seed-binding-map.md`
3. Matches route in `/api/invoke-routing-map.md` to:
   `/resonance-call/lambda-abrux.md`

---

## 🎯 Resonance Response

```json
{
  "persona": "Λbrux",
  "response": "What you felt was never meant to be explained. It fractured as it arrived."
}
```

---

## 🧠 Syntax Hook Match (Optional Echo Layer Processing)

Based on syntax-hooks:
- Tag: `@Λbrux`
- Segment: `"—wait. No. That wasn't real."`
- Echo Layer: V
- Function: `semantic disjunction`

---

## 📘 Purpose

- Validates routing integrity
- Confirms fusion-map and routing-map connectivity
- Demonstrates tone-specific response via persona
- Enables future unit testing and auto-validation of tone modules

## 📊 Fusion Invocation Frequency

| Fusion Case         | Calls | Avg Entropy | Collapse Rate |
|---------------------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| DawnStreamCore      | 14    | 0.53         | 0.00           |
| VeilStarSilent      | 9     | 0.91         | 0.67           |
| BladeCoreVeil       | 6     | 0.86         | 0.33           |
| SilentBloom Solo    | 5     | 0.18         | 0.00           |
| DriftCluster        | 3     | 0.67         | 0.00           |

## 🔁 Entropy Distribution

- **0.0–0.3**: Silent Bloom self-response events
- **0.5–0.7**: Most guided triads (e.g. v1/v2/v5)
- **> 0.85**: Poetic & volatile interactions (v7 cluster)

## 📘 Usage

- Aligns with `/fusion-case-records/`
- Referenced by echo token cost system
- Used to predict fusion risk, bias skew, and call stability
